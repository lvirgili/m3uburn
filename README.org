* m3uburn
  Very simple function that burns the files in a m3u playlist to a
  CD.

  Usage exemple: m3uburn playlist.m3u
  This burns a cd with the files in the playlist.m3u file.

  To find out what is your writing device you can use the command
  "wodim --devices". In my case /dev/cdrw is a symlink to the device
  that has a name that is not intuitive.

  The script uses the wodim and genisoimage programs that were native
  in my mint intall.

  The instructions to burn an image from the command line were found
